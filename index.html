          <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p>Hi, my name is [Name] and I am a software engineering student with a passion for artificial intelligence and machine learning. I am currently studying at [University] where I have had the opportunity to learn about the latest technologies and techniques in these fields.

In my coursework, I have gained experience in programming languages such as Python, Java, and C++, and have worked on projects involving machine learning algorithms, natural language processing, and computer vision. I have also completed internships at [Company 1] and [Company 2] where I was able to apply my knowledge and skills to real-world problems.

I am excited to continue learning and exploring the potential of AI and ML, and am looking for opportunities to gain more experience and make a meaningful contribution to these fields. I am open to internships, research positions, and full-time job opportunities in companies that are working on cutting-edge AI and ML projects.

I am a dedicated and hard-working individual with a strong aptitude for problem-solving and a passion for learning. I believe that my skills and experience make me a great candidate for opportunities in the AI and ML field, and I look forward to discussing how I can contribute to your team. Thank you for considering my application.</p>

            <h2>Natural Language Processing Application</h2>
            <p>This program is a simple speech-to-text application that allows a user to speak a sentence into their computer's microphone, and then displays the transcript of the spoken sentence on the screen, along with a list of the individual words in the sentence, with each word surrounded by inverted quotes.</p>
            <img src="TKimage.png" alt="Screenshot of the NLP project">
          <p>The program uses the speech_recognition and nltk libraries to handle the speech recognition and tokenization, respectively. It also uses the tkinter library to create a graphical user interface (GUI) with a prompt, a button to start the speech recognition, and labels to display the transcript and tokenized words. When the user clicks the "Start Speaking" button, the program records their voice, transcribes it to text, tokenizes the text into individual words, and then displays the transcript and tokenized words in the GUI.</p>
          <p>For more information, check out this <a href="https://blog.com/nlp-project">blog post</a> where I discuss the challenges and learnings from building this project.</p>
